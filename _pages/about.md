Currently I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at [UCLA Land Surface Hydrology Group](http://www.hydro.ucla.edu/index.php), working on the role of hydrological initial conditions on floods due to atmospheric rivers in a changing climate, with [Prof. Dennis Lettenmaier](https://geog.ucla.edu/person/dennis-lettenmaier/). I previously obtained my Ph.D. degree from UCLA Department of Geography with an emphasis on hydrology.

Research Interests
======
I use satellite data, in situ measurements, hydrologic models with reservoir modules, coupled hydrology and stream temperature models, and water quality models to address how climate change and human practices affect hydrologic extremes, water resource availability, and ecosystem functioning.
