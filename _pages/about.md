Currently I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at [UCLA Land Surface Hydrology Group](http://www.hydro.ucla.edu/index.php), working on climate change impacts on floods due to atmospheric rivers in coastal Western U.S. watersheds, with [Prof. Dennis Lettenmaier](https://geog.ucla.edu/person/dennis-lettenmaier/). I previously obtained my Ph.D. degree from UCLA Department of Geography with an emphasis on hydrology.

Research Interests
======
The role of hydrological initial conditions in a changing climate
I use satellite data, in situ measurements, hydrologic models with reservoir modules, coupled hydrology and stream temperature models, and water quality models to address how climate change and human practices affect hydrologic extremes, water resource availability, and ecosystem functioning.
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.
